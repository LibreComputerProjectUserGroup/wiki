Le Potato - Android 7.1
=====

Materials
---------

* MicroSD card pre loaded with aml-s905x-cc-android-7-1-preview-1.img

Procedure
---------
If the language settings are incorrect every time you boot your Le Potato running the android 7.1 preview image, it is likely the HDMI CEC keyboard detection is to blame.
You should disable it using the following steps on the android OS:

1. From the Home screen, open the settings tile to show the right hand menu

2. Open the second menu item and change the toggle of the last (4th) item in the sub menu to off (toggle on the left, shows as grey)

3. Go back to the previous menu and open the 11th item (globe icon) and select your desired language
