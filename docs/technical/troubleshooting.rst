# **Where is my video?**

  * Have you written (via `dd` or otherwise) the `*.img` file to a micro-SD card (as opposed to a USB)?
  * It is a known problem that no video appears when outputting video through the HDMI connector.
Try toggling your monitor/TV inputs and see if the video signal appears.
  * Is the blue LED blinking?
If not, please diagnose the issue via UART interface (see How-To page) for more detailed information.
