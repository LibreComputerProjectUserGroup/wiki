# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this wiki become much more comprehensive.

## Submitting changes

If you would like to be a contributor on this wiki, we would love to have you!
Message one of the contributors either here or on the Facebook users group and we will add you to the project.

Otherwise:
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to LibreComputerProjectUserGroup](https://github.com/LibreComputerProjectUserGroup/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
Please conduct an integration test before merging.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces
  * This is open source documentation.
  Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
  It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
LibreComputerProjectUserGroup
